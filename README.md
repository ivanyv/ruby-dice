# Ruby Dice

I've been using this script for a while now to generate easier to type passwords.

In the past I used LastPass' generator, but typing those passwords in a phone is beyond painful.

Hope someone finds this useful and let me know what stupid security mistakes I've made :)

## Usage

    $ gem install ruby-dice
    $ dice --help
